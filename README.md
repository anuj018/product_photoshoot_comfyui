## About the repo
This repository showcases a ComfyUI workflow that can take any image as input and generate a lifestyle background around it using models built upon the Stable Diffusion 1.5 architecture. This workflow will soon incorporate the ability to render a background for the product from any given angle while keeping it consistent and include dynamic background capabilities.
